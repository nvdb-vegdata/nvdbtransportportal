# NAP - NVDB transportportal 

Norway's national road database contains all roads in Norway. Through our API you have live access to 
the contents of the road network and more than 350 feature types attached to the road network. All 
data are freely available through [Norwegian Licence for Open Government Data (NLOD)](https://data.norge.no/nlod/en). 

At these pages we translate a subset of the [NVDB api documentation (in Norwegian)](https://api.vegdata.no) to English. 
For simple use cases we hope this will be sufficient. However, beware that the NVDB data model and data content
is complex, and for more complex queries or use cases you will need 
to understand the Norwegian API documentation or [NVDB data catalogue](https://datakatalogen.atlas.vegvesen.no/). 

We also provide a summary of the NVDB content relevant for the [National Access Point](http://transportportal.no), for the categories 
  * [Mobility services](los1.md)
  * [Traffic information](los2.md)
  * [Road network and definitions](los3.md)
